Bike Travel
====================================

## Bike Travel
An iOS app that finds the users location and zooms in on their location. After that, the program then waits for the user to enter a destination. Once a destination is entered, it drops a pin on that destination and zooms over to that pin. Finally, the program waits for the user to touch the calculate route button which then calculates the fastest route possible and draws a line connecting the user location and the destination. In the bottom right corner, it also shows the amout of time it will take to arrive at the destination and the total distance in miles. For extra functionality, in the bottom tool bar, the user is able to change the average speed for the bike ride to get an updated route time.

## Future Updates
I have many goals for this applicaiton. The first of which is to add a user location button that can zoom onto the user anytime they press a button. Future Updates will be posted here at a latter date.
