Bike Travel
====================================

## Bike Travel
An iOS app that finds the users location and zooms in on their location. It then retrieves data from Open Weather Map for the wind speed and direction and shows the data in the bottom left when it is loaded. After that, the program then waits for the user to enter a destination. Once a destination is entered, it drops a pin on that destination and zooms over to that pin. Finally, the program waits for the user to touch the calculate route button which then calculates the fastest route possible and draws a line connecting the user location and the destination. In the bottom right corner, it also shows the amout of time it will take to arrive at the destination and the total distance in miles. For extra functionality, in the bottom tool bar, the user is able to change the average speed for the bike ride to get an updated route time. Also, if the user pushes the time button the time data will switch to estimated time of arrival rather than travel time. To see travel time again, the user must just re-push calculate route. 

## Future Updates
Currently Working on the functionality to make a today widget that the users can add to their today page that will show them a quick little visiual of the wind data. Possibly later add icons to show the weather temperature and condition.

I have many goals for this applicaiton. The first function is going to be have the user to be able to drop annotation where ever they click. Eventually may be able to make a route using multiple annotations for users who want to customize their bike ride. May add calarie data for routes. 

Another possible future function is adding another view that the user can push to bring up a more user friendly view for when they are currently on a bike ride. Such could possibly include adding a updating speed area and maybe have the map follow the user and even which direction they are looking. Similar to how Apple Maps tracks when you are actually moving and getting directions. Future updates will be updated here.
